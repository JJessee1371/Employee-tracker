# Employee-tracker

## Description
A basic content management system that allows a user to build an employee tracker which will hold
all pertinent information about employees' role, salary, etc. Input is collected via the inquirer
module and then that data is used to manipulate the MySQL database where all of the teams' information
is stored. Based on what the user chooses to do, they can create new entries, update employee information,
delete records that are no longer needed, and see overviews of all the information in the database.
