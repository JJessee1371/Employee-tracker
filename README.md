# Employee-tracker

## Description
A basic content management system that allows a user to build an employee tracker which will hold
all pertinent information about that employees' role, salary, etc. Input is collected via the inquirer
module and then that data is used to manipulate the MySQL server where all of the teams' information
is stored. Based on what the user chooses to do, they can view the data stored about employees, roles,
or departments, update an employees' role, or insert new data into any of those tables.
